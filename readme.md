<h1> Huffman encoder </h1>


1. Run `make` in project directory.

2. Create any `.txt` file. For example, `file.txt`

3. Using terminal in the folder that contains the target file, run `./encoder file.txt`

4. The code will create an `output.dat` file which will be the compressed version for the file.

Note: Try compressing for larger file sizes. For extrememly small file sizes, the compressed file will be larger!

To cleanup project directory, run `make clean`. 

I hope you enjoy reading my code and playing around with the encoder :)

To decode your compressed file, use [my Huffman decoder implementation](https://github.com/AbhishekMarda/HuffmanDecoder/tree/master).
