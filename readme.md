<h1> Huffman encoding! </h1>

You can either clone this repository if you are using Xcode, or you can create a C++ project from the C++ files. 

To run from terminal, do the following steps:

1. Go to the target folder of your project with the executable file.

2. Create an any .txt file. For example, yourinputfilename.txt!

3. Using terminal in the folder that contains the target file, run `./huffmanencoder yourinputfilename.txt`

4. The code will create an output.dat file which will be the compressed version for the file.

Note: Try compressing for larger file sizes. For extrememly small file sizes, it will not work! 

I hope you enjoy reading my code and playing around with the encoder :)
