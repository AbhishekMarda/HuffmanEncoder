<h1> Huffman encoding! </h1>

You can either clone this repository if you are using Xcode, or you can create a C++ project from the C++ files. 

To run from terminal, do the following steps:

1. Go to the target folder of your project with the executable file.

2. Create any `.txt` file. For example, `yourinputfilename.txt`!

3. Using terminal in the folder that contains the target file, run `./huffmanencoder yourinputfilename.txt`

4. The code will create an `output.dat` file which will be the compressed version for the file.

Note: Try compressing for larger file sizes. For extrememly small file sizes, the compressed file will be larger! 

I hope you enjoy reading my code and playing around with the encoder :)

To decode your compressed file, use [my Huffman decoder implementation](https://github.com/AbhishekMarda/HuffmanDecoder/tree/master).
